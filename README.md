# X (Twitter UI Clone)

This project is a front-end clone of the Twitter (now X) user interface, built using HTML, CSS (Tailwind CSS and custom styles), and JavaScript. It aims to replicate the look and feel of Twitter's main feed, sidebar, and trending sections.

## Features

- **Responsive Layout:** Sidebar, main feed, and right panel adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Sidebar Navigation:** Includes Home, Explore, Notifications, Messages, Grok, Communities, Premium, Verified Orgs, Profile, and More.
- **Post Creation:** Users can type a post, add media, GIFs, polls, emojis, schedule, and location.
- **Feed Tabs:** Switch between "For you" and "Following" feeds.
- **Interactive Post Actions:** Comment, repost, like, poll, bookmark, and upvote icons with hover effects.
- **Trending Section:** Shows trending topics, live events, and suggestions on who to follow.
- **Live Events:** Highlighted live events with images and participant info.
- **Who to Follow:** Suggestions with follow buttons.
- **Footer:** Terms, privacy, cookie policy, accessibility, and more.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Markup for structure.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
